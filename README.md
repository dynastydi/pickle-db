WIP - CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL

Low-level minimalist database built in Rust.

Currently working on pagination, serialisation & B+ tree opreations.



Rust is a modern competitor to memory-safe low-level languages like C.

ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation & durability) properties are fundamental to database transactions.

Removing rust from steel with hydrochloric acid is called 'pickling'... it's a stretch.
